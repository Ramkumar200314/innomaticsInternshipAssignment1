# Assignment 1: Final Examination Schedule Table

## Overview
This project is part of my internship at Innomatic Research Labs. The goal of this assignment is to create a simple table using basic HTML and CSS to display a final examination schedule. The table is styled to be visually appealing and responsive, with proper layout and formatting.

## Table Description
The table represents a *Final Examination Schedule* for Fall 2008, showing various subjects scheduled across multiple days and times. It includes a column for the time slots, and each row corresponds to a different examination time. The last column is a "HOME" column, which spans across all the rows and is highlighted to stand out.

### Features:
- *HTML Structure*: Basic table with header and data rows.
- *CSS Styling*: Custom styling for:
  - *Table layout* with borders and padding.
  - *Header and time columns* for easy readability.
  - *Color schemes* for time, home, and schedule cells.
- *Flexbox Layout*: The entire table is centered on the page using Flexbox, making it responsive to different screen sizes.
  
## File Structure:
- *index.html*: The main HTML file that contains the table structure.
- *CSS (embedded in HTML)*: The style block inside the <head> element contains CSS rules for the table design and layout.
